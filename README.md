# EnergyPrediction

Photovoltaic solar energy is booming due to the continuous improvement in the 
efficiency of photovoltaic panels together with a downward trend in production costs. In 
addition, the European Union's commitment to a 30% share of renewable energy is 
enabling many companies to obtain financing and install their own PV panels.


However, the nature of solar energy is intermittent and uncontrollable, leading to 
instability in the PV systems that supply power. The literature has tried to model this 
problem through different models ranging from multi-linear regressions to the use of 
deep neural networks. The main problem is the multitude of factors that can influence 
the prediction, making each model very different and making it difficult to compare 
models trained in different locations.


This project develops a methodology for fitting a model for predicting photovoltaic 
energy production on a farm in Scotland. It reviews the most commonly used 
techniques in the literature, using statistical techniques such as moving averages, 
through tree-based techniques, and finally using neural network models.
The objective is to obtain a model capable of accurately predicting the energy to be 
produced in the next hour, using past information as predictor variables
